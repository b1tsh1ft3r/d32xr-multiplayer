# DOOM 32X: Resurrection Multiplayer

## Description

The goal of this project was to add in system link play for Doom32X Resurrection which was put together by Victor Luchits. It allows
for CO-OP or Deathmatch and uses the 2nd controller port on each console for networking ability.

The multiplayer mode in this version requires a custom made cable which requires 3 wires. See the diagram below for information
on how to hook it up.

Looking directly at 2nd controller port of MegaDrive.

```
   SEGA 1                      SEGA 2
 CTRL PORT 2                CTRL PORT 2
-------------              -------------
\ 5 4 3 2 1 /              \ 5 4 3 2 1 /
 \ 9 8 7 6 /                \ 9 8 7 6 /
  -|-|---|-                  -|-|---|-
   | |   ---------------------- |   |
   | ----------------------------   |
   ----------------------------------
```
Pin 6 = TX
Pin 8 = Ground
Pin 9 = RX

Pin 6 from one console must go to pin 9 on the other console and vice-versa. Ground will connect straight through from each console
to each other.
