There are many remixes of the Doom and Doom 2 soundtrack. You can find
many of them on the Brutal Doom Addon Downloads page. Here's a link to
the music download page:

The specific remix in my videos is Doom Metal Volume 4, found here:

This gives you a wad file with the replacement music. Any wad editor
can be used to extract the individual tracks from the wad. I tend to
use Slade for my Doom wad modification needs. The extracted tracks are
a mix of Doom 1 and Doom 2, as the wad works for either one. You want
to make the CD using certain tracks in a particular order.

Note that the version of Doom Metal Vol 4 I originally downloaded from
DoomWorld didn't have d_inter.ogg - I used that from another
compilation... no idea which one. The currently posted Vol 4 has a
very good intermission. They also changed a couple tracks, including
one of the demo levels. I need to remake my CD. :D

Note that there are currently seven volumes of Doom Metal. I suggest
you get them all and find the one that you like the best. That said,
volume 4 is very nice as you can hear in the video I posted.

If you use all the tracks above, the play time is just shy of 69
minutes, and fits easily onto a standard CDR. Any CD/DVD/BD software
suite should be able to burn a standard audio CD. I use xfburn in
Xubuntu.
